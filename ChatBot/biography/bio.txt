Mike Tyson was born on June 30, 1966, in Brooklyn, New York. He rose to fame as a professional boxer and became the youngest heavyweight champion in history at the age of 20. Tyson was known for his aggressive fighting style and knockout power, earning the nickname "Iron Mike." Throughout his career, he achieved 50 wins, 44 of which were by knockout, and suffered 6 losses. His reign as a champion included unifying the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles. Tyson's career faced challenges due to personal and legal issues, including a conviction in 1992 that led to a three-year prison sentence. Despite these setbacks, he returned to the ring and continued to compete at a high level. Tysonâ€™s later years included notable bouts such as his fights against Evander Holyfield, including the infamous 1997 rematch where he was disqualified for biting Holyfield's ear. After retiring from boxing in 2005, Tyson transitioned into other ventures, including acting, producing a one-man show, and launching a cannabis business. He remains a cultural icon and is considered one of the greatest heavyweights in boxing history.
